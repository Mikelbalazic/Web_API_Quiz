# Web_API_Quiz
This challenge illustrates the use of Web API's to develop a javascript quiz that stores your comparable high scores


At the beginning of the quiz, you are presnted with a button with the option to start the quiz

Once the button is clicked, the quiz begins and the timer start. If a question is answered correctly, the next question will appear.
If the question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds are taken off of your overall time.

If the timer reaches 0 seconds, an alert appears that informs the user that their time has run out and they must retake the quiz.

If the timer does not run out, the user will see their score out of 5. Below this, the user has the option to inout their initals and store their highscore in local storage. They can also see any previus highscores that were submitted by other users on the same local storage. 

Below the list of highscores, there is a retry button that allows the user to retake the quiz if they did not get all answers correct.


This challenge was a lot of fun and the functionality of javascript truly began to sink in while working on it. I am very proud of how it turned out and I am looking forward to working on the next challenge.
